# cLinkedList

I decided I couldn't be a Linux user without knowing how to write C.  This is 
the first piece of C I've written.  It's a really simple implementation of a linked list 
(and it's probably not a very good one) but it was just to test how well I understood 
what I read about pointers and dynamic memory allocation.

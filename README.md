# cLinkedList

I decided I couldn't be a Linux user without knowing how to write C and C++.  This is 
the first piece of C I've written.  It's a really simple implementation of a linked list 
(and it's probably not a very good one) but it was just to test my reading about pointers 
and dynamic memory allocation.
